# Tic Tac Toe — Ocean Professional (React)

A clean, modern Tic Tac Toe game built with React and styled using the Ocean Professional theme (blue primary, amber secondary, subtle gradients, rounded corners, and soft shadows).

## Features
- Classic 3x3 Tic Tac Toe gameplay
- Status indicator (turn, win, draw)
- Reset control
- Smooth transitions, gradient surfaces, and modern rounded components
- Accessible controls and ARIA labels
- Lightweight: pure React + CSS (no heavy UI framework)

## Getting Started

In the project directory:

- `npm start` — run the app in development mode at http://localhost:3000
- `npm test` — run tests
- `npm run build` — build the app for production

## Styling

Key palette (defined in `src/App.css`):
- Primary: `#2563EB` (blue)
- Secondary: `#F59E0B` (amber)
- Background: `#f9fafb`
- Surface: `#ffffff`
- Text: `#111827`

The board is centered with a card-like surface, rounded corners, and subtle shadows. Interactive elements use the primary gradient accent with hover elevation.

## Project Structure

- `src/App.js` — Game logic, board, and UI
- `src/App.css` — Theme variables and component styles
- `src/index.js` — App entry

Enjoy the game!
